# VTK for QtPyVCP on Raspberry Pi

QtPyVCP utilises VTK to provide GCode back plot functionality. Unfortunately there is no pip package for VTK and the normal installation of QtPyVCP fails. Below is the procedure using the development installation instructions with some adjustmentsto to use a specifically compiled version of VTK 7.1.1 with Qt5 and Python 2 wrapping.


### STEP 1: Download and install

Download and install the VTK deb pacakge.

``` 
wget https://github.com/scottalford75/LinuxCNC-on-RPi/blob/master/Pi%20OS/vtk_7.1.1-qt5py2-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i vtk_7.1.1-qt5py2-1_armhf.deb
```


### STEP 2: Update Python Path 

Modify your ```.bashrc``` file in your home directory and add the following line. This will add the path to your PYTHONPATH each time xwindows starts.

```
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/vtk:$PYTHONPATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/vtk:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```


### STEP 3: Install dependencies

Install dependencies as per the QtPyVCP installation guide.

VTK 7.1.1 also has the following dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install libnetcdf-cxx-legacy-dev libjsoncpp-dev libgl2ps-dev
```


### STEP 4: Modify the install 

In the qtpyvcp source directory, modify the setup.py and comment out the VTK dependency.

```
    install_requires=[
        'docopt',
        'qtpy',
        'pyudev',
        'psutil',
        'HiYaPyCo',
        'pyopengl',
        #'vtk',
        'pyqtgraph',
        'more-itertools',
    ],
```

### STEP 5: Install QtPyVCP

Install QtPyVCP as per normal development installation instructions.

```pip install --editable .```

### STEP 6: Add simulation configurations

If you want to test with the simulation configurations simply copy the config directory from the ```~/qtpyvcp/linuxcnc/configs``` directory into your ```~/linuxcnc/configs``` directory.
