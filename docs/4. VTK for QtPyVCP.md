# VTK for QtPyVCP on Raspberry Pi

QtPyVCP utilises VTK to provide GCode back plot functionality. Unfortunately there is no pip package for VTK and the normal installation of QtPyVCP fails. Below is the procedure using the development installation instructions with some adjustmentsto to use a specifically compiled version of VTK 8.2.0 with Qt5 and Python 2 wrapping.

1. Download and install the VTK deb pacakge.

``` 
wget https://github.com/scottalford75/LinuxCNC-on-RPi/blob/master/Pi%20OS/vtk_8.2.0-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i vtk_8.2.0-1_armhf.deb
```

2. Create a ```.xsessionrc``` file in your home directory and add the following line. This will add the path to your PYTHONPATH each time xwindows starts.

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/python2.7/site-packages
```

3. Install dependencies as per the QtPyVCP installation guide.

4. Modify the setup.py and comment out the VTK dependency.

```
    install_requires=[
        'docopt',
        'qtpy',
        'pyudev',
        'psutil',
        'HiYaPyCo',
        'pyopengl',
        #'vtk',
        'pyqtgraph',
        'more-itertools',
    ],
```

5. Install

```pip install --editable .```

6. If you want to test with the simulation configurations simply copy the config directory from the ```~/qtpyvcp/linuxcnc/configs``` directory into your ```~/linuxcnc/configs``` directory.
